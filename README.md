# Analyzing and Improving IP Multicast Performance Over Wi-Fi Based Networks

Earlier, because of hardware constraints, implementation difficulties and high battery consumption issues, Multicast was not very popular. But with advancing technology it has become possible to consider the trade-offs between the flexibility of multicast and its aforementioned negatives as a viable option. The flexibility of multicast coupled with the development of strong resilient network infrastructure has resulted in this technology breaking into the mainstream network traffic. But since itâ€™s a new and unexplored technology it is still rough around the edges and needs research and improvement. In this project, our primary objective is to experimentally find a few issues in multicast communication and try to troubleshoot them and release all our results to the open-source community. We have worked on Multicast with the access point and now we will be working with multicast over Wi-Fi Direct.

Our previous work on Multicast with an access point is available in online GitHub repository https://github.com/rajat276/MultiCastTestApp.
